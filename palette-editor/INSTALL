Installation procedures
-----------------------

Currently there is no proper Python package. I'll appreticate any help in
creating it, as I'm not experienced in creating them. So, list of depencencies:

* Python v. 2.5, 2.6, 2.7. I think it should also work with 3.*, but i've not tested it.
* PyQt4.
* Numpy.
* lxml.
* LCMS bindings (v. 1.19 will be OK) - optional, used for LCh and Lab color
  models. They simply will not be available if you have not LCMS bindings
  installed.
* TinyCSS - optional. Used for loading (parsing) CSS files.
* PIL or Pillow - optional. Used for loading raster images as palettes.
* python-colourlovers - optional. Used to download palettes from colorlovers.com.
* scikit-learn - optional, not used by default. Can be used as alternative
  variant for loading raster images as palettes.

On most Linux distributions, you can just run "gui.py" after installing that depencencies.

For Windows, distribution can be created with PyInstaller and (optionally) NSIS:

* To compile scripts into Windows executable files, run "pyinstaller
  windows\gui.spec" (under Windows or under Wine) This will create a folder
  "dist\gui" with set of binary files (gui.exe is the main executable file).
  You can distribute that folder any way you want.
* To create proper installer, run "makensis colors.nsis" (this can be done
  under Linux or Windows). This will create file "dist\palette-editor.exe".
