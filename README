color-palette
=============

Set of Python (+Qt) scripts to work with colors, color harmonies, mixing of colors, and edit color palettes.

What can it do currently is:

* Work with colors. There is Color class in color.py (based on QColor), and you
  can convert it from/to different color models. There are some standard models
  supported (RGB, CMYK, HSV) as well as some experimental (RYB). Some models
  implementation is depending on python LCMS bindings (LCh, Lab).
* Mix colors. There are some set of color-mixing algorithms. Currently
  implemented algorithms just convert color to some color space (LCh, for
  example), and do linear interpolation in that space.
* Calculate color harmonies. There are two basic classes: Harmony and Shader.
  Harmony is an algorithm how to get some list of harmonic (well, in some way)
  colors from one color. Shader is an algorithm how to get a list of similar
  shades of one color. Combining Harmonies and Shaders, one can potentially get
  some interesting results.
* There is some set of color-related widgets for PyQt4, for example - a widget
  which displays color and lets you select another color by clicking on it.
* There is also a color-selector widget, which can work with different color
  models. Currently, it works more or less well with HLS and LCh models.
* There is a port of my palette implementation for MyPaint
  (http://wiki.mypaint.info/Iportnovs_en#Palette) to PyQt4. This implementation
  is split into several modules: one for palette generation and handling
  (totally independent of any GUI, except of my Color and Mixer classes, which
  are not actually GUI); one for rendering palette into QImage; and one for
  displaying and editing palette using PyQt4 widget.

There is also some old pygtk stuff, maybe it will be usefull for someone.

Documentation is actually almost absent at the moment, so you can just read source :)

You can try launch&play with some testing executable scripts:
* palette_viewer.py — a viewer for `*.gpl' (Gimp palette) files
* gui.py — a script for testing GUI, showing palette editor, color selector,
  harmonic colors generation.
